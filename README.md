This is the source code of a runtime environment for the process control domain. It is developed since around 1999 at the [Chair of Process Control Engineering](http://www.plt.rwth-aachen.de).
It is well known in the German process control community under the name of the core technology ACPLT/OV.

Right now the build system is hard coded to the internal SVN server of the chair; therefore the build script is not published right now.

The runtime environment runs on Linux (x86, x64, ARM) and Windows (x86).

The runtime environment is used at industry scale in the petro chemical plants at INEOS in Cologne.
